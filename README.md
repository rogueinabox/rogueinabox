  Rogueinabox is a higly modular learning environment built around the videogame Rogue, the father of the roguelike genre.
  It offers easy ways to interact with the game and a whole framework to build, customize and run learning agents.
  It comes with a library of pre-built modules that was developed during our research and experimentation with different agents designs.
